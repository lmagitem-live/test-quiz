This project can be interacted with [on https://quiz.n42c.dev/](https://quiz.n42c.dev/).

And you can check out my [github account here](https://github.com/lmagitem).

What should be improved if it were a real project:

- Add documentation/change style according to project rules
- Fix the check-box bug (when one clicks on the whole button, the checkbox is selected, but on the checkbox itself there is no selection)
- Consolidate CSS
- Check accessibility
- Add (more?) responsiveness
- Make utils methods out of the ComputedSignals lambdas
- Add unit tests, especially to utils methods
- Add E2E tests
- Change routes so that /questions/:id and /results are children of /game/:hash
