What should be improved:

- Add documentation/change style according to project rules
- Consolidate CSS
- Check accessibility
- Add responsiveness
- Split up stores and services so that they cover smaller perimeters
- Make utils methods out of the ComputedSignals lambdas
- Add unit tests, especially to utils methods
- Add E2E tests
- Change routes so that /questions/:id and /results are children of /game/:hash
